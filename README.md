<h1>Botium Toys - Internal Security Audit</h1>

<h2>Description</h2>

This project consists of a company named Botium Toys who is currently under marketing pressure to increase their sales market by pushing into the E.U. In order to do this, the company wants to audit their compliance. They also want to establish best practices as they revamp their security measures in line with their goals: 

To adhere to the NIST CSF, establish a better process for their systems to ensure they are compliant, and fortify system controls.
Botium Toys also wants to adapt to the concept of least permissions when it comes to user credential management, establish their policies and procedures, which includes their playbooks and ensure they are meeting compliance requirements.
